1) go to env.setup and source the specific compiler config file
   e.g., source gfortran.setup
   note: make sure the following three evn variables are 
   already defined or included in the esetup file.
    B shell (sh, bash)
         export CSEM_HOME=path to the package home 
         export NETCDF_HOME=path to the netcdf 
         export HDF5_HOME=path to the hdf5
    C shell (csh)
         setenv CSEM_HOME    path to the package home
         setenv NETCDF_HOME  path to the netcdf
         setenv HDF5_HOME    path to the hdf5
    run step 1) for complete the first time fresh installation or as long as 
    these three evn variables are changed.
    
2) generate the file "configure"
    ./autogen.sh
3) generate the file "Makefile", you may specify where the CSEM library will be 
   installed. The default is the current directory
    ./configure --prefix=path for the CSEM library installation
4) make
5) make install
